<h1>URL Shortener Microservice</h1>

1) Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://little-url.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.

2) Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

3) Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

4) User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

5) User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

6) User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

7) Pro Tip: Checkout this wiki article for tips on integrating MongoDB on Glitch.

8) Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.

9) You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
